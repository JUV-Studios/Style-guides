Do not use the hyphen in between 'and or' as well.Do not use serial comma unless the conjunction also takes place in a element listed, to improve clarity.Do not capitalise after colon and semicolon, unless the first word is a proper noun.## TitlesWe do not generally use title case.Do not use question and exclamation marks in titles.## SpellingWe use the -ise suffix, which is more common in British English, rather than the -ize suffix, which recommended by Oxford. We also use a few less common spellings.- Connection -> Connexion- Reflection -> Reflexion- Inflection -> Inflexion- Sulphur -> Sulfur[^1]- Programme -> Program[^2]## Quotation marksUse single quotes as the primary quotation marks and use double quotes inside an existing quotation.Place punctuation marks after the end quotation mark unless it is part of the quoted text.[^1]: As per as per IUPACâ€™s recommendation.[^2]: To be consistent with most other words ending 'gram', use 'program' in all cases and not just when referring to computer ones.
