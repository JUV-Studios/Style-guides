# JUV Studios English style guide
We mainly follow British English.

## Grammar
Do not use contractions.

Use triple dots rather than et cetera (etc).

### Punctuation
Do not capitalise after the: colon or semicolon unless inherent[^3].

#### The colon
We use the colon to avoid repeating a starting phrase that is part also implicitly part of two or more phrases joined with a conjunction.
This usage is non-standard but helps in improving clarity.

#### The comma (,)
Do not use serial comma, expect for improving clarity when conjunctions also take place in list elements.

Do not include the comma after introductory phrases unless there is more than: four words and or twenty letters. However, this does not apply to single-word adverbs.

#### The slash (/)
Do not use the hyphen in place of a conjunction. Do not use the hyphen in between 'and or' as well. You may, however, use them along with ampersand (&) when not writing full sentences.

#### The hyphen (-)
Do hyphenate words as appropriate.

## Titles
We do not generally use title case.

Do not use question and exclamation marks in titles.

Do not capitalise table headers unless inherent[^3].

## Spelling
We use the -ise suffix, which is more common in British English, rather than the -ize suffix, which recommended by Oxford.

We also use a few less common spellings.

| commoner spelling | our spelling |
| -- | -- |
| connection | connexion |
| reflection | reflexion |
| inflection | inflexion |
| sulphur | sulfur[^1] |
| programme | program[^2] |
| doubt | doute |
| Brazil | Brasil 
| Tamil | Thamizh |

'-ce' + '-ate' should be '-ciate' instead of the traditional '-tiate'. Examples: differenciate, instanciate...

Use traditional, irregular plural forms. For example use 'formulae' instead of 'formulas'.

### Accented characters
> These rules do not apply to identifiers in computer code, as most people cannot type accented characters.

#### Diaeresis
The two dots over a vowel is called diaeresis. In addition to loanwords with these, use these with other English words when two vowels next to each other need to be pronounced separately, while usually the combination represents a single sound.

##### Examples
- reäl
- appeär
- whereäs
- coördinate

You will notice that we use the diaeresis in more words compared to traditional usage. Therefore, you may not always find our spelling listed in dictionaries.

#### Diacritics
In addition to loanwords having diacritics, use these with the words listed below.

| commoner spelling | our spelling |
| -- | -- |
| learned (adjective) | learnèd |
| read (past tense) | rèad |
| lead (metal) | lèad |

Diacritics should not be used in certain loanwords where it does not make any difference to the English reader. For example do not write 'rôle' or 'hôtel'; the silent 'e' already clarifies the pronunciation of 'o'.

#### Ligatures
Do not use ligatures such as 'æ' or 'œ'. Instead, always use the two letters separately.

## Quotation marks
Use single quotes as the primary quotation marks and single quotes inside an existing quotation.

Place punctuation marks after the end quote unless it is part of the quoted text.

***
[^1]: As per as per IUPAC’s recommendation.

[^2]: To be consistent with most other words ending 'gram', use 'program' in all cases and not just when referring to computer ones.

[^3]: Inherent capitalisation: needing to always capitalise a word due to it being a proper noun - not just when it is the first word of a sentence.
